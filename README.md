Java Fighting Game

This is a fast-paced, two-player fighting game built using Java and Swing. It features essential fighting game mechanics, including physics-based movement (gravity and jumping) and strategic blocking with built-in cooldowns to prevent abuse.

Key Features

The core game logic has been carefully designed for a balanced competitive experience:

Directional Attacks: Attacks only hit on the side the player is facing, requiring proper positioning.

Strategic Crouching: Players can crouch to lower their hitbox, essential for dodging standing attacks.

Dynamic Hitboxes: Attacks have two different hitboxes:

Standing Attack: Hits mid-level (can be dodged by crouching).

Crouching Attack: Hits low (must be blocked).

Cooldown Blocking: Blocks absorb 100% of damage, but instantly disable the block and trigger a 2-second cooldown upon successful connection.
